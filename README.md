# üìß Mail Merge Automation for Google Sheets & Gmail

A Google Apps Script project for managing event registrations in Google Sheets. This script automates sending personalized bulk emails by using Gmail drafts as templates, triggered by status changes made directly in the sheet. It's designed to be powerful, flexible, and easy to manage for any event.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **‚úçÔ∏è Status-Driven Automation:** Automatically sends a specific email when a participant's status is changed (e.g., from "Registered" to "Confirmed").
- **üìù Gmail Draft Templates:** Uses your pre-written Gmail drafts as rich HTML email templates, complete with images and attachments.
- **üåç Centralized Configuration:** Manages all event details (names, dates, fees, email subjects) from a central "General" sheet for easy updates without touching the code.
- **üîó Flexible Placeholders:** Use placeholders for both global data (like `{{eventName}}`) and row-specific data (like `{{fname}}` or `{{fees}}`) in any email.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Built-in Utilities:** Includes tools to check who hasn't received an email, debug data issues, and clear the script's cache.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This system uses two main Google Sheets and a Google Apps Script to create a powerful mail merge workflow:

1.  **`General` Sheet:** This sheet acts as your master control panel. You define all your event-wide parameters here, such as the event name, dates, fees, and other details you want to use in your emails.
2.  **`Mailer` Sheet:** This is your operational sheet. It contains the list of participants, their details, and a special `Status` column. When you change the value in the `Status` column for any participant, the script triggers.
3.  **Gmail Drafts:** You create email templates as simple drafts in your Gmail account. You can use placeholders in both the subject and the body.
4.  **The Script:** The Apps Script is the engine that connects everything. When a status is changed, it finds the correct email draft, combines the global data from the `General` sheet with the specific participant's data from the `Mailer` sheet, and sends a personalized email.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to get the system up and running.

### 1. üìù Set Up Your Google Sheets

You need two sheets in the same Google Sheets document:

**A. The `General` Sheet:**

- Create a new sheet and name it **`General`**.
- Set up three columns: `Parameter Name`, `Value`, and `Email Alias`.
- Populate this sheet with all your event-wide data. The script will read the `Value` (Column C) and make it available using the `Email Alias` (Column D).

*Example:*
| Parameter Name | Value | Email Alias |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Event Name | Wieda Summer Hike 2025 | `{{event}}` |
| Registration Deadline | 23.08.2025 | `{{regDeadline}}` |
| Organizer Email | info@forwards-team.eu | `{{orgEmail}}` |

**B. The `Mailer` Sheet:**

- Create a second sheet and name it **`Mailer`**. This is where your participant data will live (you can use an `ARRAYFORMULA` to pull data from another sheet, like a Google Form response sheet).
- It must contain a **Status** column (the name can be configured in the script). This column should use Data Validation to create a dropdown menu with your defined statuses (e.g., "Registered", "Confirmed", "Reminded", etc.).
- It must also contain columns for any data you want to use in your emails, like `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, and `Fees`.

### 2. ‚úçÔ∏è Create Your Gmail Drafts

- In your Gmail account, compose a new email for each status.
- **The Subject Line is Critical:** The subject of the draft must **exactly match** the `draftSubject` defined in the script's configuration. You can use global placeholders here.
    - *Example Subject:* `Registration Confirmation - {{event}}`
- **Use Placeholders:** Write your email body using both global placeholders (from the `General` sheet) and row-specific placeholders (from the `Mailer` sheet).
    - *Example Body:* `Hello {{fname}}, thank you for registering for the {{event}}! Your total fee is {{fees}}.`
- Save each email as a draft. Do not send it!

### 3. üíª Install and Configure the Script

1.  **Open the Script Editor:** In your Google Sheet, go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.
2.  **Paste the Code:** Delete any existing code and paste the entire script from the `mail_merge_v2` artifact.
3.  **Configure the `CONFIG` Block:** Carefully review the `CONFIG` object at the top of the script and ensure all the sheet names, column names, and status mappings match your setup exactly.
4.  **Save the Project:** Click the "Save project" icon.

### 4. üîê Authorize the Script

1.  **Run the Setup Trigger:** In the script editor, select the `createSpreadsheetEditTrigger` function from the dropdown menu and click **Run**.
2.  **Authorization Required:** A dialog box will appear. Click "Review permissions".
3.  **Choose Your Account:** Select the Google account you want to run the script from.
4.  **Advanced Warning:** You will likely see a "Google hasn‚Äôt verified this app" screen. This is normal. Click **"Advanced"**, then click **"Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)"**.
5.  **Grant Permissions:** Review the permissions the script needs (to manage your sheets and send email on your behalf) and click **"Allow"**.
6.  You should see a "Success!" message in your spreadsheet. The automation is now active!

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use the Automation Menu

After reloading your spreadsheet, you will see a new **"Mail Merge Automation"** menu.

- **Setup Edit Trigger:** Run this once during setup to activate the automation.
- **Check Sent Status vs. Gmail:** A utility to check who on your list has not received a specific email. It will ask for the email column and the subject line to check against your Gmail Sent folder.
- **Debug Last Edit:** An essential troubleshooting tool. After editing a status, run this to see the exact data the script is trying to use for its placeholders. This helps you find typos in column names or other data issues.
- **Clear Cache & Re-read General Sheet:** The script saves a copy of your `General` sheet data for performance. If you make changes to the `General` sheet, run this to force the script to read the new data immediately.

## üí° Placeholders Guide

You can use two types of placeholders in your Gmail draft subjects and bodies:

1.  **Global Placeholders:** These pull data from your `General` sheet.
    - **Format:** `{{alias}}` (e.g., `{{event}}`, `{{regDeadline}}`)
    - Defined by the `Email Alias` column in your `General` sheet.
2.  **Row-Specific Placeholders:** These pull data from the participant's row in the `Mailer` sheet.
    - **Format:** `{{alias}}` or `{{Column Name}}`
    - You can use short aliases defined in the `PLACEHOLDER_ALIASES` section of the script (e.g., `{{fname}}` for the "First name" column) or use the full column name directly (e.g., `{{First name}}`).

The script is smart enough to use data from both sheets to compose the final email!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Emails Not Sending:**
    1.  Ensure you have run the `Setup Edit Trigger` and authorized the script.
    2.  Check that the status you are selecting in the dropdown exactly matches a status defined in the `STATUS_MAPPINGS` in the script.
    3.  Check that the subject of your Gmail draft exactly matches the `draftSubject` for that status in the script.
- **Placeholders Not Working (`{{fees}}` shows up as `{{fees}}`):**
    1.  Run the `Debug Last Edit` tool immediately after an edit.
    2.  Examine the `ROW DATA` section. Check if the column header (e.g., "Fees") is spelled correctly and has no extra spaces.
    3.  Examine the `GLOBAL DATA` section. Make sure you haven't accidentally defined a row-specific placeholder (like `{{fees}}`) in your `General` sheet.
- **Changes to `General` Sheet Not Appearing:**
    1.  Run the `Clear Cache & Re-read General Sheet` command from the menu.
